# Autism-Prediction

This is Autism Prediction Model.

The [data](./data) folder has Raw dataset. And [ndata](./ndata) folder has cleaned data.

I used raw dataset to clean, analyse and train model in the notebook. And the cleaned data was used to create the tableau report about the data.

[Dashboard](./Dashboard_1.png) is the Tableau Dashboard I created for this Dataset.

[app](./app.py) has code to clean the data and save it in ndata folder by the same name.

[ipynb file](./autism-prediction.ipynb) has the entire process of cleaning, EDA and modelling.


Till my next project, see ya!
